Note: Under some legislations, the Owner may be allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to such processing (“opt-out”), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases. This, however, does not apply whenever the processing of Personal Data is subject to European data protection law;</li>
                      <li>Provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof;</li>
